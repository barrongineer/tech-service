('Java', 'Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,[12] and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA),[13] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[14] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2015, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[15][16] Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licences. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Others have also developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).'),
('Groovy', 'Groovy is an object-oriented programming language for the Java platform. It is a dynamic language with features similar to those of Python, Ruby, Perl, and Smalltalk. It can be used as a scripting language for the Java Platform, is dynamically compiled to Java Virtual Machine (JVM) bytecode, and interoperates with other Java code and libraries. Groovy uses a Java-like curly-bracket syntax. Most Java code is also syntactically valid Groovy, although semantics may be different. Groovy 1.0 was released on January 2, 2007, and Groovy 2.0 in July, 2012. Groovy 3.0 is planned for release in late 2015, with support for a new Meta Object Protocol.[2] Since version 2, Groovy can also be compiled statically, offering type inference and performance very close to that of Java.[3][4] Groovy 2.4 will be the last major release under Pivotal Softwares sponsorship, which is scheduled to end on March 31, 2015.[5]'),
('Scala', 'Scala (/?sk??l?/ skah-l?)[6] is an object-functional[7] programming language for general software applications. Scala has full support for functional programming and a very strong static type system. This allows programs written in Scala to be very concise and thus smaller in size than other general-purpose programming languages. Many of Scalas design decisions were inspired by criticism of the shortcomings of Java.[5] Scala source code is intended to be compiled to Java bytecode, so that the resulting executable code runs on a Java virtual machine. Java libraries may be used directly in Scala code and vice versa (language interoperability).[8] Like Java, Scala is object-oriented, and uses a curly-brace syntax reminiscent of the C programming language. Unlike Java, Scala has many features of functional programming languages like Scheme, Standard ML and Haskell, including currying, type inference, immutability, lazy evaluation, and pattern matching. It also has an advanced type system supporting algebraic data types, covariance and contravariance, higher-order types, and anonymous types. Other features of Scala not present in Java include operator overloading, optional parameters, named parameters, raw strings, and no checked exceptions. The name Scala is a portmanteau of "scalable" and "language", signifying that it is designed to grow with the demands of its users.[7]'),
('Kotlin', 'Kotlin is a statically-typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine and also can be compiled to JavaScript source code. Its primary development is from a team of JetBrains programmers based in Saint Petersburg, Russia (the name comes from the Kotlin Island, near St. Petersburg).[1] Kotlin was named Language of the Month in the January 2012 issue of Dr. Dobbs Journal.[2] While not syntax compatible with Java, Kotlin is designed to interoperate with Java code and is reliant on Java code from the existing Java Class Library, such as the Collections Framework.'),
('Clojure', 'Clojure (pronounced like "closure"[3]) is a dialect of the Lisp programming language created by Rich Hickey. Clojure is a general-purpose programming language with an emphasis on functional programming. It runs on the Java Virtual Machine, Common Language Runtime, and JavaScript engines. Like other Lisps, Clojure treats code as data and has a macro system. Clojures focus on programming with immutable values and explicit progression-of-time constructs are intended to facilitate the development of more robust programs, particularly multithreaded ones.'),
('C#', 'C#[note 2] (pronounced as see sharp) is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270:2006). C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure. C# is intended to be a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language.[7] Its development team is led by Anders Hejlsberg. The most recent version is C# 5.0, which was released on August 15, 2012.'),
('C', 'C (/?si?/, as in the letter c) is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language. It supports structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems. C was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at AT&T Bell Labs,[5] and used to (re-)implement the Unix operating system.[6] It has since become one of the most widely used programming languages of all time,[7][8] with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) since 1989 (see ANSI C) and subsequently by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Many later languages have borrowed directly or indirectly from C, including C++, D, Go, Rust, Java, JavaScript, Limbo, LPC, C#, Objective-C, Perl, PHP, Python, Verilog (hardware description language),[4] and Unixs C shell. These languages have drawn many of their control structures and other basic features from C, usually with overall syntactical similarity to C that sometimes includes identical simple control structures.[9][10][11] C is also used as an intermediate language for other languages,[12] and for building standard libraries and runtime systems for higher-level languages, such as CPython.[13]'),
('C++', 'C++ (pronounced as see plus plus, /?si? pl?s pl?s/) is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing the facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is designed with a bias toward system programming (e.g., for use in embedded systems or operating system kernels), with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design requirements. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, including desktop applications, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search or SQL servers), performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes), and entertainment software.[3] C++ is a compiled language, with implementations of it available on many platforms and provided by various organizations, including the FSF, LLVM, Microsoft and Intel. C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest (and current) standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2014 as ISO/IEC 14882:2014 (informally known as C++14).[4] The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, ISO/IEC 14882:2003, standard. The current C++14 standard supersedes these and C++11, with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs, starting in 1979, who wanted an efficient flexible language (like the C language), which also provided high-level features for program organization. Many other programming languages have been influenced by C++, including C#, Java, and newer versions of C (after 1998).'),
('F#', 'F# (pronounced eff sharp) is a strongly typed, multi-paradigm programming language that encompasses functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming techniques. F# is most often used as a cross-platform CLI language, but can also be used to generate JavaScript[4] and GPU[5] code. F# is developed by the F# Software Foundation,[6] Microsoft and open contributors. An open source, cross-platform compiler for F# is available from the F# Software Foundation.[7] F# is also a fully supported language in Visual Studio[8] and Xamarin Studio.[9] Other tools supporting F# development include Mono, MonoDevelop, SharpDevelop and WebSharper.[10] F# originated from ML and has been influenced by OCaml, C#, Python, Haskell,[2] Scala and Erlang.'),
('Go', 'Go, also commonly referred to as golang, is a programming language initially developed at Google[7] in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.[6] It is a statically-typed language with syntax loosely derived from that of C, adding garbage collection, type safety, some dynamic-typing capabilities, additional built-in types such as variable-length arrays and key-value maps, and a large standard library. The language was announced in November 2009 and is now used in some of Googles production systems.[8] Gos "gc" compiler targets the Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Plan 9, and Microsoft Windows operating systems and the i386, amd64, ARM and IBM POWER processor architectures.[9] A second compiler, gccgo, is a GCC frontend.[10][11]'),
('Python', 'Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.[17][18][19] Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.[20][21] The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.[22] Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library.[23] Python interpreters are available for installation on many operating systems, allowing Python code execution on a wide variety of systems. Using third-party tools, such as Py2exe or Pyinstaller,[24] Python code can be packaged into stand-alone executable programs for some of the most popular operating systems, allowing for the distribution of Python-based software for use on those environments without requiring the installation of a Python interpreter. CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is free and open-source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its alternative implementations. CPython is managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.'),
('Ruby', 'Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan. According to its authors, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp.[13] It supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and imperative. It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.'),
('Rust', 'Rust is a general purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Mozilla Research.[11] It is designed to be a "safe, concurrent, practical language",[12][13] supporting pure-functional, concurrent-actor, imperative-procedural, and object-oriented styles. The language grew out of a personal project by Mozilla employee Graydon Hoare. Mozilla began sponsoring the project in 2009[14] and announced it for the first time in 2010.[15] The same year, work shifted from the initial compiler (written in OCaml) to the self-hosted compiler written in Rust itself.[16] Known as rustc, it successfully compiled itself in 2011.[17] The self-hosted compiler uses LLVM as its backend. The first numbered pre-alpha release of the Rust compiler occurred in January 2012.[18] Development moves quickly enough that using the stable releases is discouraged.[1] Rust is developed entirely in the open and solicits feedback and contributions from the community. The design of the language has been refined through the experiences of writing the Servo[19] layout engine and the Rust compiler itself. Although its development is sponsored by Mozilla, it is a community project. A large portion of current commits are from community members.[20]'),
('Erlang', 'Erlang (/??rlæ?/ er-lang) is a general-purpose concurrent, garbage-collected programming language and runtime system. The sequential subset of Erlang is a functional language, with eager evaluation, single assignment, and dynamic typing. It was designed by Ericsson to support distributed, fault-tolerant, soft-real-time, non-stop applications. It supports hot swapping, so that code can be changed without stopping a system.[4] While threads require external library support in most languages, Erlang provides language-level features for creating and managing processes with the aim of simplifying concurrent programming. Though all concurrency is explicit in Erlang, processes communicate using message passing instead of shared variables, which removes the need for explicit locks (a locking scheme is still used internally by the VM[5]). The first version was developed by Joe Armstrong, Robert Virding and Mike Williams in 1986.[6] It was originally a proprietary language within Ericsson, but was released as open source in 1998.'),
('Haskell', 'Haskell /?hæsk?l/[22] is a standardized, general-purpose purely functional programming language, with non-strict semantics and strong static typing.[23] It is named after logician Haskell Curry.[24]'),
('Javascript', 'JavaScript (/?d???v???skr?pt/; JS) is a dynamic computer programming language.[5] It is most commonly used as part of Web browsers, whose implementations allow client-side scripts to interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that is displayed.[5] It is also used in server-side network programming with runtime environments such as Node.js, game development and the creation of desktop and mobile applications. With the rise of the single-page Web app and JavaScript-heavy sites, it is increasingly being used as a compile target for source-to-source compilers from both dynamic languages and static languages. In particular, Emscripten and highly optimised JIT compilers, in tandem with asm.js that is friendly to AOT compilers like OdinMonkey, have enabled C and C++ programs to be compiled into JavaScript and execute at near-native speeds, making JavaScript be considered the "assembly language of the Web",[6] according to its creator and others. JavaScript is classified as a prototype-based scripting language with dynamic typing and first-class functions. This mix of features makes it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented,[7] imperative, and functional[1][8] programming styles. Despite some naming, syntactic, and standard library similarities, JavaScript and Java are otherwise unrelated and have very different semantics. The syntax of JavaScript is actually derived from C, while the semantics and design are influenced by the Self and Scheme programming languages.[9] JavaScript is also used in environments that arent Web-based, such as PDF documents, site-specific browsers, and desktop widgets. Newer and faster JavaScript virtual machines (VMs) and platforms built upon them have also increased the popularity of JavaScript for server-side Web applications. On the client side, JavaScript has been traditionally implemented as an interpreted language, but more recent browsers perform just-in-time compilation. JavaScript has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification.'),
('Dart', 'Dart is an open-source Web programming language developed by Google. It was unveiled at the GOTO conference in Aarhus, October 10–12, 2011.[4] In order to run in mainstream browsers, Dart relies on a source-to-source compiler to JavaScript. Dart had a mixed reception and the Dart initiative has been criticized by industry leaders for fragmenting the web. According to the project site, Dart was "designed to be easy to write development tools for, well-suited to modern app development, and capable of high-performance implementations."[5] Dart is a class-based, single inheritance, object-oriented language with C-style syntax. It supports interfaces, abstract classes, reified generics, and optional typing. Static type annotations do not affect the runtime semantics of the code. Instead, the type annotations can provide documentation for tools like static checkers and dynamic run time checks.'),
('Typescript', 'TypeScript is a free and open source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing and class-based object-oriented programming to the language. Anders Hejlsberg, lead architect of C# and creator of Delphi and Turbo Pascal, has worked on the development of TypeScript.[3][4][5][6] TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript.[7] As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, any existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs. TypeScript supports header files which can contain type information of existing JavaScript libraries, enabling other programs to use objects defined in the header files as if they were strongly typed TypeScript objects. There are third-party header files for popular libraries like jQuery, MongoDB, Node.js, and D3.js.[8] TypeScript is licensed under the Apache 2 License.'),
('Coffeescript', 'CoffeeScript is a programming language that transcompiles to JavaScript. It adds syntactic sugar inspired by Ruby, Python and Haskell[1] to enhance JavaScripts brevity and readability.[3] Specific additional features include list comprehension and pattern matching.

('Cassandra', 'Apache Cassandra is an open source distributed database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure. Cassandra offers robust support for clusters spanning multiple datacenters,[1] with asynchronous masterless replication allowing low latency operations for all clients. Cassandra also places a high value on performance. In 2012, University of Toronto researchers studying NoSQL systems concluded that "In terms of scalability, there is a clear winner throughout our experiments. Cassandra achieves the highest throughput for the maximum number of nodes in all experiments" although "this comes at the price of high write and read latencies."[2] Cassandras data model is a partitioned row store with tunable consistency.[3] Rows are organized into tables; the first component of a tables primary key is the partition key; within a partition, rows are clustered by the remaining columns of the key.[4] Other columns may be indexed separately from the primary key.[5] Tables may be created, dropped, and altered at runtime without blocking updates and queries.[6] Cassandra does not support joins or subqueries, except for batch analysis via Hadoop. Rather, Cassandra emphasizes denormalization through features like collections.[7]'),
('Redis', 'Redis is a data structure server. It is open-source, networked, in-memory, and stores keys with optional durability. The development of Redis has been sponsored by Pivotal Software since May 2013;[3] before that, it was sponsored by VMware.[4][5] According to the monthly ranking by DB-Engines.com, Redis is the most popular key-value store.[6] The name Redis means REmote DIctionary Server.[7]'),

('HBase', 'HBase is an open source, non-relational, distributed database modeled after Googles BigTable and written in Java. It is developed as part of Apache Software Foundations Apache Hadoop project and runs on top of HDFS (Hadoop Distributed Filesystem), providing BigTable-like capabilities for Hadoop. That is, it provides a fault-tolerant way of storing large quantities of sparse data (small amounts of information caught within a large collection of empty or unimportant data, such as finding the 50 largest items in a group of 2 billion records, or finding the non-zero items representing less than 0.1% of a huge collection). HBase features compression, in-memory operation, and Bloom filters on a per-column basis as outlined in the original BigTable paper.[1] Tables in HBase can serve as the input and output for MapReduce jobs run in Hadoop, and may be accessed through the Java API but also through REST, Avro or Thrift gateway APIs. HBase is not a direct replacement for a classic SQL database, although recently its performance has improved, and it is now serving several data-driven websites,[2][3] including Facebooks Messaging Platform.[4][5] In the parlance of Eric Brewer’s CAP theorem, HBase is a CP type system.'),

('Apache Hadoop', 'Apache Hadoop is a set of algorithms (an open-source software framework written in Java) for distributed storage and distributed processing of very large data sets (Big Data) on computer clusters built from commodity hardware. All the modules in Hadoop are designed with a fundamental assumption that hardware failures (of individual machines, or racks of machines) are commonplace and thus should be automatically handled in software by the framework. The core of Apache Hadoop consists of a storage part (Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)) and a processing part (MapReduce). Hadoop splits files into large blocks (default 64MB or 128MB) and distributes the blocks amongst the nodes in the cluster. To process the data, Hadoop Map/Reduce transfers code (specifically Jar files) to nodes that have the required data, which the nodes then process in parallel. This approach takes advantage of data locality[3] to allow the data to be processed faster and more efficiently via distributed processing than by using a more conventional supercomputer architecture that relies on a parallel file system where computation and data are connected via high-speed networking.[4]'),
('Apache Spark', 'Apache Spark is an open-source cluster computing framework originally developed in the AMPLab at UC Berkeley. In contrast to Hadoops two-stage disk-based MapReduce paradigm, Sparks in-memory primitives provide performance up to 100 times faster for certain applications.[1] By allowing user programs to load data into a clusters memory and query it repeatedly, Spark is well suited to machine learning algorithms.[2] Spark requires a cluster manager and a distributed storage system. For cluster management, Spark supports standalone (native Spark cluster), Hadoop YARN, or Apache Mesos.[3] For distributed storage, Spark can interface with a wide variety, including Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS),[4] Cassandra,[5] OpenStack Swift, and Amazon S3. Spark also supports a pseudo-distributed local mode, usually used only for development or testing purposes, where distributed storage is not required and the local file system can be used instead; in this scenario, Spark is running on a single machine with one executor per CPU core. Spark has over 465 contributors in 2014,[6] making it the most active project in the Apache Software Foundation and among Big Data open source projects.'),
('Apache Storm', 'Apache Storm is a distributed computation framework written predominantly in the Clojure programming language. Originally created by Nathan Marz[1] and team at BackType,[2] the project was open sourced after being acquired by Twitter.[3] It uses custom created "spouts" and "bolts" to define information sources and manipulations to allow batch, distributed processing of streaming data. The initial release was on 17 September 2011.[4] A Storm application is designed as a topology in the shape of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with spouts and bolts acting as the graph vertices. Edges on the graph are named streams and direct data from one node to another. Together, the topology acts as a data transformation pipeline. At a superficial level the general topology structure is similar to a MapReduce job, with the main difference being that data is processed in real-time as opposed to in individual batches. Additionally, Storm topologies run indefinitely until killed, while a MapReduce job DAG must eventually end.[5] Storm became an Apache Top-Level Project in September 2014[6] and was previously an Apache Incubator project since September 2013.[7][8]');
